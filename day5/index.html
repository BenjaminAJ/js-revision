      //Loops used to iterate over a block of code a number of times.

      //for loop: A for loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given boolean condition.
      //The for loop consists of three expressions: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.

      //for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
      //    // code block to be executed
      //}

      //   for (let index = 1; index < 6; index++) {
      //     console.log(index); // 1 2 3 4 5
      //   }
      //   for (let index = 1; index <= 5; index++) {
      //     console.log(index); // 1 2 3 4 5
      //   }

      //decrementing the index

        // for (let index = 5; index >= 0; index--){
        //   console.log(index); //5 4 3 2 1 0

        // }

      //while loop: A while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given boolean condition.
      //The while loop consists of a condition and a block of code to be executed.

      // while (condition){
      //     // code block to be executed
      // }
    //   let index = -1;
    //   while (index >= 0) {
    //     console.log(index);
    //     index--;
    //   }



        //do while loop: A do while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given boolean condition.
        //The do while loop consists of a block of code to be executed and a condition.

        // do {
        //     // code block to be executed
        // } while (condition);
        let index = 5;
        // do{
        //     console.log(index);
        //     if (index == 3) {
        //         break; //break statement will terminate the loop when index is 3
        //     }
        //     index--;
        // }while (index >= 0);

        //The do while loop will execute the block of code once before checking the condition, even if the condition is false.
        //This means that the code block will always be executed at least once, regardless of the condition.
        //The while loop will only execute the block of code if the condition is true.
        //This means that the code block may not be executed at all if the condition is false.


        //break
        //The break statement is used to terminate a loop or switch statement.
        //When a break statement is encountered, the loop or switch statement is immediately terminated and control is transferred to the statement following the loop or switch statement.
        //continue
        //The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and continue with the next iteration.
