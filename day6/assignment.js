//Exercises:
//1. Create a string variable called "sentence" and assign it the value "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
//2. Use the slice() method to extract the word "quick" from the sentence and store it in a variable called "extractedWord".
//3. Use the toUpperCase() method to convert "extractedWord" to uppercase and store it in a variable called "upperWord".
//4. Use the indexOf() method to find the position of the word "fox" in the original sentence and store it in a variable called "foxPosition".
//5. Use the includes() method to check if the sentence contains the word "lazy" and store the result in a variable called "containsLazy".
//6. Use the trim() method to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the sentence and store the result in a variable called "trimmedSentence".
//7. Use the length property to find the total number of characters in the original sentence and store it in a variable called "sentenceLength".
//8. Use the charAt() method to get the character at index 5 of the original sentence and store it in a variable called "charAtIndex5".
//9. Use the startsWith() method to check if the sentence starts with "The" and store the result in a variable called "startsWithThe".
//10. Use the endsWith() method to check if the sentence ends with "dog." and store the result in a variable called "endsWithDog".

//13. Use the split() method to split the original sentence into an array of words and store it in a variable called "wordArray".
