      //Local vs Global Variables
      //Local variables are declared inside a function and can only be accessed within that function.
      //Global variables are declared outside of any function and can be accessed from anywhere in the code.

      let globalVar = "ben"; //global variable

      // console.log(globalVar, "globalVar");

      function myFunction() {
        let localVar = "ben"; //local variable

        console.log(localVar, "localVar");
        //Garbage Collection: The process of automatically freeing up memory by removing objects that are no longer in use.
        //In JavaScript, the garbage collector automatically frees up memory by removing objects that are no longer referenced in the code.
        //This helps to prevent memory leaks and keeps the code running efficiently.
        //GIGO - Garbage In, Garbage Out: This principle states that the quality of output is determined by the quality of the input.
      }

      // myFunction(); // This will log "ben" to the console

      // console.log(localVar);
      let userName = "ben"; //global variable
      // console.log(userName, "userName"); // This will log "ben" to the console

      if (true) {
        let userName = "john"; //local variable

        // console.log(userName);
      }
      // console.log(userName); // This will log "ben" to the console

      //Scope: The context in which a variable is declared and can be accessed.
      //In JavaScript, there are two types of scope: global scope and local scope.

      //Global scope: Variables declared outside of any function or block are in the global scope and can be accessed from anywhere in the code.
      //Local scope: Variables declared inside a function or block are in the local scope and can only be accessed within that function or block.

      //Block scope: Variables declared inside a block (e.g., if statement, for loop) are in the block scope and can only be accessed within that block.

      //Ternary Operator: A shorthand way of writing an if-else statement. It takes three operands: a condition, a value if the condition is true, and a value if the condition is false.
      //Syntax: condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse

      // if(condition){
      //     //code to be executed if condition is true
      // }
      // else{
      //     //code to be executed if condition is false
      // }

      // condition ? truthyStatement : falsyStatement; //Ternary

      let age = 10;

      let isAdult = age >= 18 ? "Adult" : "Not Adult"; //Ternary Operator: returns "Adult" if age is greater than or equal to 18, otherwise returns "Not Adult"
      console.log(isAdult);

      age >= 18 ? console.log("Adult") : console.log("Not Adult"); //Ternary Operator: logs "Adult" if age is greater than or equal to 18, otherwise logs "Not Adult"

      //Logical Operators: Operators that are used to combine or negate boolean values.
      //In JavaScript, there are three logical operators: AND (&&), OR (||), and NOT (!).

      //AND (&&): Returns true if both operands are true, otherwise returns false.
      //Syntax: operand1 && operand2

      let num1 = 10;
      let num2 = 20;

      console.log(num1 > 5 && num2 < 30); // true
      console.log(num1 < 5 && num2 < 30); //false
      console.log(num1 < 5 && num2 > 30); //false

      //OR (||): Returns true if at least one operand is true, otherwise returns false.
      //Syntax: operand1 || operand2

      console.log(num1 > 5 || num2 < 30); //true
      console.log(num1 < 5 || num2 < 30); //true
      console.log(num1 < 5 || num2 > 30); //false

      //NOT (!): Returns true if the operand is false, otherwise returns false.
      //Syntax: !operand

      console.log(!(num1 > 5)); //false //negates the boolean value of the expression
      console.log(!true); //false
      console.log(!false); //true
